  "extract": "Pietro Mascagni was an Italian composer primarily known for his operas. His 1890 masterpiece Cavalleria rusticana caused one of the greatest sensations in opera history and single-handedly ushered in the Verismo movement in Italian dramatic music. While it was often held that Mascagni, like Ruggero Leoncavallo, was a \"one-opera man\" who could never repeat his first success, L'amico Fritz and Iris have remained in the repertoire in Europe since their premieres.",
