The libretto was written by Béla Balázs, a poet and friend of the composer, and is written in Hungarian, based on the French literary tale La Barbe bleue by Charles Perrault. The opera lasts only a little over an hour and there are just two singing characters onstage: Bluebeard, and his new wife Judith ; the two have just eloped and Judith is coming home to Bluebeard's castle for the first time.",
