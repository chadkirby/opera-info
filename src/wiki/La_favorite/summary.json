The opera concerns the romantic struggles of the King of Castile, Alfonso XI, and his mistress, the \"favourite\" Leonora, against the backdrop of the political wiles of receding Moorish Spain and the life of the Catholic Church. It premiered on 2 December 1840 at the Académie Royale de Musique in Paris.",
