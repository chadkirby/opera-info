  "extract": "Johann Baptist Strauss II, also known as Johann Strauss Jr., the Younger, the Son, was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as \"The Waltz King\", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include \"The Blue Danube\", \"Kaiser-Walzer\", \"Tales from the Vienna Woods\", \"Frühlingsstimmen\", and the \"Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka\". Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the best known.",
