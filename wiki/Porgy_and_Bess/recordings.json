It was billed as a \"complete\" version, but was complete only insofar as that was the way the work was usually performed then. (Actually, nearly an hour was cut from the opera.) Because album producer <a href=\"/wiki/Goddard_Lieberson\" title=\"Goddard Lieberson\">Goddard Lieberson</a> was eager to bring as much of <i>Porgy and Bess</i> as he felt was practical on records at the time, the recording featured more of Gershwin's original recitatives and orchestrations than had ever been heard before. The recording was conducted by <a href=\"/wiki/Lehman_Engel\" title=\"Lehman Engel\">Lehman Engel</a>, and starred <a href=\"/wiki/Lawrence_Winters\" title=\"Lawrence Winters\">Lawrence Winters</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Camilla_Williams\" title=\"Camilla Williams\">Camilla Williams</a>, both from the <a href=\"/wiki/New_York_City_Opera\" title=\"New York City Opera\">New York City Opera</a>. Several singers who had been associated with the original 1935 production and the 1942 revival of <i>Porgy and Bess</i> were finally given a chance to record their roles more or less complete. The album was highly acclaimed as a giant step in recorded opera in its time. It was re-released at budget price on the Odyssey label in the early 1970s. It has subsequently appeared on CD on Sony's \"Masterworks Heritage\" CD series, and on the Naxos label as well. The album is not sung in as directly \"operatic\" a style as later versions, treading a fine line between opera and musical theater.<sup class=\"noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact\" style=\"white-space:nowrap;\">[<i><a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\"><span title=\"This claim needs references to reliable sources.
