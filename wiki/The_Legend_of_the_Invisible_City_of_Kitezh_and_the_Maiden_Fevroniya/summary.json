The libretto was written by Vladimir Belsky, and is based on a combination of two Russian legends: that of Saint Fevroniya of Murom, and the city of Kitezh, which became invisible when attacked by the Tatars. The opera was completed in 1905, and the premiere performance took place at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, on February 7, 1907, the last in Rimsky-Korsakov‘s lifetime.",
